/**
 * Configures the `test` tasks of this project so that the JaCoCo agent is
 * attached to the Gradle TestKit worker JVMs they spawn.
 *
 * `Plugin<Settings>` implementations and other plugin code exercised through
 * [`GradleRunner`][org.gradle.testkit.runner.GradleRunner] run in a separate
 * worker JVM. Kover (and JaCoCo) instrument only the test JVM, so that
 * out-of-process execution is otherwise not credited to coverage.
 *
 * This method:
 *
 *  1. Resolves the standalone JaCoCo agent JAR pinned to [Jacoco.version]
 *     through a dedicated [AGENT_CONFIGURATION] configuration.
 *  2. Passes the agent JAR path and a per-module exec directory
 *     (`build/`[TESTKIT_COVERAGE_DIR]) to the test JVM as system properties.
 *     The `plugin-testlib` harness reads these and writes a `gradle.properties`
 *     into the worker's Gradle user home that adds `-javaagent:…` to the worker JVM.
 *  3. Wipes the exec directory at most once per build invocation, from the
 *     `doFirst` of the first `Test` task that actually executes, so stale worker
 *     coverage from a previous run does not accumulate. Two failure modes are
 *     avoided deliberately:
 *      - Cleaning is **not** wired through a `dependsOn` clean task. Such a task
 *        would run even when the `Test` task is up-to-date or restored from
 *        cache, deleting the `.exec` files without regenerating them — a later
 *        `koverXmlReport`/`check` run would then drop all TestKit coverage. A
 *        `doFirst` action runs only when the task truly executes.
 *      - The wipe is guarded by a one-shot flag so that, when a module declares
 *        several TestKit `Test` tasks, only the first to run clears the
 *        directory. The workers append to a single per-module exec file, so the
 *        remaining tasks accumulate into it instead of erasing one another.
 *  4. Marks the `Test` tasks non-cacheable. The worker `.exec` data is flushed
 *     out-of-process on worker-daemon shutdown, *after* the task action
 *     completes, so it cannot be declared as a task output and captured by the
 *     build cache. Were the task left cacheable, a cache hit would skip
 *     execution and restore no exec files, leaving Kover with no TestKit
 *     coverage. An up-to-date (non-cache) run is unaffected: the previous run's
 *     files remain on disk and the guarded `doFirst` never deletes them.
 *
 * The produced `.exec` files are merged into the Kover reports by
 * [io.spine.gradle.report.coverage.KoverConfig]. The agent emits binary
 * execution data rather than an XML report because that is its only file output,
 * and because Kover merges binary data at the probe level — see `KoverConfig`
 * for why binary, not XML.
 *
 * The method is idempotent and may be called once per module that runs
 * TestKit-based tests.
